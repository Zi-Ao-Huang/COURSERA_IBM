# Capstone project for IBM Data Science Specialization on Coursera
When people come to a foreign city for the first time, looking to get a real sense of a destination through its cuisine and dining culture, often the sheer volume of choice can make determining what to eat an exhausting experience.
The goal of this project is to provide a dining and restaurant guide for people who plans to travel to Osaka. In addition, this project may offer useful information for people who wants to invest or open a restaurant in Osaka.
